				<h3>Gameplay</h3>
				<div class="gameplay">
					<h4>Intro</h4>
					<p>Natural Annihilation is a aerial 2D Tower Defence game set on a disaster struck Earth that is trying to evacuate to a new world. You take control of an alien, who is tasked with stopping earth from polluting the rest of the galaxy. You do this by using turrets and units to stop them getting to their escape vessel. You have several turrets and units for you to use to stop them achieving their goal.</p>

					<p>The main player unit is their turrets. These turrets manipulate the elements to destroy the enemy units trying to escape. Each turret has its own strengths and weaknesses, with some being better suited to specific enemy units or locations. The turrets can be placed anywhere on land apart from the actual track that the enemy units follow. Each turret costs a certain amount of credits to place.</p>
					<h4>Unique Feature</h4>
					<p>The unique feature of Natural Annihilation is the deployable units the player can call in and control to aid his turrets. They can be deployed to anywhere on the battlefield apart from the path the enemies follow. Only one can be on the battlefield at a time to reduce confusion. There are two units the player can deploy each with a different ability/skill. See Deployable Units <!-- Add Section link --> section for more info</p>
					<h4>Towers</h4>
					<h5>Lighning Tower</h5>
					<img src="res/spr_Lightning_Tower_0.png" />
					<p>The Lighting Tower attracts electricity and stores it in massive alien capacitors, when fully charged it will release and all nearby units will be struck with significant damage. It is mainly attracted to vehicles because they are metal (conductors) while people will go relatively unharmed because the lightning isn’t attracted to them. It is very fast to charge up and release at the enemies, and can affect any unit in a moderate range.
					The tower looks similar to a Radio Tower made of grey rusted metal.</p>
					<h5>Earthquake Tower</h5>
					<img src="res/spr_Earthquake_Tower_0.png" />
					<p>The Earthquake Tower is similar in design to a pile driver which raises a column of metal and then propelling it into the ground which will cause a seismic disturbance. Ordinarily a pile driver couldn’t cause an earthquake, but this turret is powered by a powerful generator that propels the column at a massively increased speed. It causes massive damage but only targets one enemy at a time, and takes a while to lift the heavy column back into position. It also has a very limited range, so can only hit nearby units.
					The Earthquake Tower looks like a massive platform similar to an oil rig, with a massive metal pillar in the middle. It has a rusty metallic frame, holding its massive weight. There is a strange alien looking machine located on top which is the power source.</p>
					<h4>Deployable Units</h4>
					<h5>Tank</h5>
					<img src="res/spr_Player_Tank_4.png" />
					<p>The tank is a standard offensive unit that the player can utilise to help his turrets destroy the enemy. It fires a laser beam as its offensive weapon, which deals moderate damage to vehicles but massive damage to people. If it collides with a unit the tank is immediately destroyed. The tank looks like a human design but modified with some alien enhancements, like the laser cannon.</p>
					<h5>Armoured Van</h5>
					<img src="res/spr_Armoured_Van_4.png" />
					<p>The Armoured Van has no offensive weapon; its primary use is to deploy oil onto the path. When an enemy unit runs through it, it will slow enemy units for a slight duration. It is intended mainly as an emergency unit to stop the enemies temporarily while the player can focus on building defences.
					It looks like a standard van covered in shiny thick metal.</p>
