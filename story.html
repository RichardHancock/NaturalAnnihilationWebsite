					<h4>Back Story</h4>
					<p>The Tranquil are an alien civilization that is a very natural race that lives in harmony with nature. When they discovered the Human race and saw how little care they gave to their planet, it disgusted them. They judged that the Human race was not worthy of existing on Earth, so they began a Terraforming process to restore Earth to its original Eden state. But first the humans must be eliminated. At this point Humanity had already suffered from massive natural disasters; Human civilization was almost destroyed, with entire countries being flooded or the terrain becoming unfertile. Once the Terraforming process had begun and escalated disasters even further,  the Human Race decided the planet was dying and formed an escape plan to colonize a new world.</p>
					<h4>Game Story</h4>
					<p>The game starts just as The Tranquil finds out about Humanity’s escape plans, so starts formulating a plan of action. The player plays the alien agent who is sent to Earth to stop them. An alien invasion would make short work of the humans, but the mission is one of a secretive nature, because not everyone in the galaxy agrees with the Tranquil’s decision to annihilate the humans.</p>
